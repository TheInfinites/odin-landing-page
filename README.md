# odin-landing-page

For Steve.

This is my assignment submission for The Odin Project (Foundations => Flexbox => Project)
I had a lot of fun creating this. I really can't wait to get started with JavaScript! 

Note:
This website is not a one to one replication of the assignment.
I ended up changing a lot of things. Right from the color to the layout. 
I did want to add some scroll animation when it comes to clicking the nav links but I believe that requires JS. Currently, the page just jumps to the sections. Not happy with that.
